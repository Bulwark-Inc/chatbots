# Customer Service Chatbot

This is a simple Python-based chatbot that handles customer service queries. It supports multiple states like:
- Greeting
- Working Hours
- Services
- Location
- Contact Information
- Fallback for unrecognized queries
- Exit to end the conversation

## How to Run the Chatbot
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the chatbot using Python:


## How it Works
The chatbot uses **state management** to handle user queries and transitions through different states like working hours, services, location, and contact info. The bot is designed to understand common variations of user input using **regular expressions**.

## Future Improvements
- Add more states and responses for a richer conversation.
- Implement machine learning to understand a wider range of user inputs.
